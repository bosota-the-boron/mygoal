üìú README for Vigen√®re Cipher Cryptanalysis Project
üîí Project Overview

Welcome to the Vigen√®re Cipher Cryptanalysis project! This initiative aims to explore the fascinating world of cryptography by developing a tool that can decrypt messages encoded with the Vigen√®re cipher. This classic encryption method, known for its historical significance and complexity, presents an exciting challenge for anyone interested in cybersecurity and intelligence.
üöÄ Why This Project?

The Vigen√®re cipher is a polyalphabetic substitution cipher that was once considered unbreakable. However, with the right techniques, it can be decrypted without knowing the key. This project not only provides an opportunity to delve into cryptographic algorithms but also enhances skills in programming, data analysis, and problem-solving.

By participating in this project, you'll gain hands-on experience in:

    Understanding encryption methods
    Implementing algorithms in C
    Analyzing data through frequency analysis
    Developing brute-force techniques for cryptanalysis

üõ†Ô∏è Project Goals

The primary objectives of this project include:

    Implementing Encryption and Decryption: Create functions to handle the Vigen√®re cipher, allowing users to encrypt and decrypt messages.
    Frequency Analysis: Develop an algorithm to analyze letter frequencies in ciphertext, which is crucial for estimating the key length.
    Brute Force Attack: Design a brute-force method to systematically test all possible key combinations until the correct one is found.
    Heuristic Evaluation: Utilize heuristics to improve the quality of decryptions by identifying common words and patterns in the text.
